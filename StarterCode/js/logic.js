/*Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.

   * Your data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. 
     Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color.

   * Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

   * Create a legend that will provide context for your map data.

   * Your visualization should look something like the map above.


   * to run this application run python -m http.server 
        -> make sure you open the terminal at the location the index.html file is located

 *        1.2 Resources -- https://leafletjs.com/reference-1.3.4.html#geojson
 * 
 * 
 *   Step 2: We can use the options in the GeoJson file to color our map 
 *        2.1: We need to color the map based on the Earthquake Manitude
